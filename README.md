# University Assembly Projects
This repository contains assembly language projects targeting different architectures. The projects are categorized as follows:

# RISC-V Project - Animated Image Erase

The RISC-V project involves the erasure of a 24 bpp .bmp image by turning all its pixels black, one by one, following a clockwise direction starting from the top-left corner. The display is implemented using RARS bitmap display.

# x86 Projects - Emphasize8 Function

The x86 projects focus on the emphasize8 function. The function enhances the dynamic range of an 8 bpp grayscale image. The goal is to transform the darkest shade to black and the lightest shade to white while proportionally adjusting the intermediate shades.

### Versions Implemented
- x86 32-bit Version
- x86 64-bit Version

# Additional Utilities
### 8 bpp Image Generator
An 8 bpp image generator is provided to facilitate easy testing of the x86 projects. This generator aids in generating sample images to evaluate the emphasize8 function's performance.

### Small algorithmic tasks
Several simple programs with comments on what exactly each program is doing. Both in RISC-V and X86.
